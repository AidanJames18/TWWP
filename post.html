                        <p>Tiger Woods holds many records in the world of golf, including some that are still standing today. He holds the record for the most consecutive weeks ranked as the world number one golfer, spending a total of 683 weeks at the top of the rankings. Woods also holds the record for the lowest scoring average in a single PGA Tour season, with an average of 68.17 strokes per round in 2000. He is the youngest golfer to have won all four major championships, accomplishing the feat at the age of 24. Additionally, Woods holds the record for the largest margin of victory in a major championship, winning the 2000 U.S. Open by 15 strokes.</p>
                        <p>Tiger also holds the record for highest career win percentage with over 22%. This means he wins about every 1/5 tournaments that he competes in. The person in second place is Jack Nicklaus with about 12%. </p>
                        <p>Another unbelievable statatisic is Tigers score to par in his career in major tournaments. Tigers career score to par in major tournaments is over 120 strokes UNDER par, second place on this list is Phil Mickelson at over 100 strokes OVER par. Meaning tiger has nearly a 300 stroke advantage to the next place player in major tournaments.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Tournament Performance</h2>
                        <p>Woods turned professional in 1996 and immediately made his presence felt on the golfing scene, winning his first tournament, the Las Vegas Invitational, in October of that year. He followed this up with a win at the Walt Disney World/Oldsmobile Classic a few weeks later, becoming the youngest ever player to win two PGA Tour events.

                            Over the next few years, Woods continued to rack up wins, including his first major championship, the Masters, in 1997. He won his second major, the PGA Championship, in 1999, and his third, the U.S. Open, in 2000. That year, he also became the first player to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles.
                            
                            In 2001, Woods won his second Masters and his fourth major overall, the Open Championship. He went on to win the Masters again in 2002, making him the first player since Jack Nicklaus to win back-to-back titles at Augusta National.
                            
                            Woods continued his dominance in the early 2000s, winning the U.S. Open in 2002 and 2008, the PGA Championship in 2000, 2006, and 2007, and the Open Championship in 2005 and 2006. In 2000, he also won the U.S. Open by a record-breaking 15 strokes, cementing his place as one of the greatest golfers of all time..</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Comeback.</h2>
                        <p>The 2019 Masters will go down in history as one of the greatest moments in the career of Tiger Woods, as he staged an incredible comeback to win his fifth green jacket, and his first major championship in over a decade.

                            Woods had endured a series of personal and professional setbacks in the years leading up to the 2019 Masters, including multiple surgeries and a highly publicized scandal. His career had been in doubt, and many had written him off as a serious contender in major championships.
                            
                            But Woods had never lost his competitive spirit, and he began to show signs of a comeback in the latter part of 2018. He finished second at the PGA Championship, and then won the Tour Championship, his first victory in over five years.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Tiger Wins The 2019 Masters Tournament In An Amzaing Career Comeback.</span>
                        <p>Entering the 2019 Masters, Woods was still considered a long shot by many, but he quickly proved that he was back to his old self. He shot a 70 in the first round, and then followed it up with a 68 in the second round to sit just one shot off the lead heading into the weekend.

                            On Saturday, Woods shot a 67, his best round of the tournament, to move into a tie for second place, just two shots behind the leader, Francesco Molinari. On Sunday, he put on a clinic, shooting a 70 to finish 13 under par and win the tournament by one stroke.
                            
                            Woods' win was remarkable for many reasons, not least because he had to contend with a field of younger players who had grown up idolizing him. It was also a testament to his resilience, his determination, and his unwavering belief in his own ability.
                            
                            In the aftermath of his victory, Woods was emotional, embracing his family and his supporters as he celebrated one of the greatest moments of his career. His win at the 2019 Masters will go down in history as one of the greatest comebacks in the history of sports, and a testament to the enduring legacy of one of golf's all-time greats.</p>
